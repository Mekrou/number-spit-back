# number-spit-back

Following Bjarne Stroustrup's "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" exercises, I created this program.

Chapter 4 Exercise 7 is as follows:
"Make a vector holding the ten string values "zero", "one", . . . "nine". Use that in a program that converts a digit 
 to its corresponding spelled-out value; e.g., the input 7 gives the output seven. Have the same program, using the same 
 input loop, convert spelled-out numbers into their digit form; e.g., the input seven gives the output 7."
 
 This was my solution, as compared to https://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/Ch4/e4-7.cpp.
